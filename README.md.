# ResNet Deep Learning Model  
This repository contains an implementation of a ResNet-based deep learning model.  

## Project Details  
- **Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Purpose:** Image classification using a deep residual network  
- **Notebook:** `ResNet_new.ipynb`  

## How to Use  
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
2.The model is allready trained and the resulst are displayed.
3.But you can Run all cells sequentially to train the model to see it live.
